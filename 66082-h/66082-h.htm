<p>Nuclear energy is playing a vital role in
the life of every man, woman, and child in the
United States today. In the years ahead it will
affect increasingly all the peoples of the earth.
It is essential that all Americans gain an
understanding of this vital force if they are to
discharge thoughtfully their responsibilities as
citizens and if they are to realize fully the
myriad benefits that nuclear energy offers
them.</p>
<p>The United States Atomic Energy Commission
provides this booklet to help you
achieve such understanding.</p>

<p>This painting, originally believed to be the
work of the Dutch artist Frans Hals
(1580-1666), is a fake. Measurements of the
naturally radioactive isotopes, polonium-210
and radium-226, in lead white from the paint
proved that it was no more than 50 years old.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">The Mysterious Box</span></h2>
<p>The New Jersey sun was high overhead
and the day was hot. The three boys walking
along a deserted stretch of beach didn&rsquo;t mind
because they were barefoot and in their
swimsuits. Occasionally they would dash in
and out of the surf to cool off.</p>
<p>Suddenly Martin let out a yell as his toe
hit something hard hidden in the sand at the
water&rsquo;s edge. A moment later Bill and Harley
were helping Martin dig out a large wooden
case. It was heavy, well built, tightly sealed,
and had foreign words written on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s a pirate treasure chest,&rdquo; said
Martin, who was almost eight and had just
read <i>Treasure Island</i> for the first time the
week before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy,&rdquo; said Harley, who, nearly
ten, was much older and wiser.</p>
<p>Bill, going on twelve, thought aloud, &ldquo;It
must be something worthwhile; maybe we can
sell it and buy those model rockets we
wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three boys soon found that they
couldn&rsquo;t open the box and that it was too
heavy to drag along the sand easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;get Dad while Harley
and I stand guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two hours later the box was at their
house and everyone in the family was trying
to read what was written on it. About all that
was readable was a large &ldquo;U&rdquo; followed
by what appeared to be two numbers. Some
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
of the other marks looked like old German
script and there was a date, 1945.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;I bet that came
from a World War II German submarine that
our Coast Guard or Navy sank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s open it up!&rdquo; said Harley as Martin
ran to get the screwdrivers.</p>
<p>Inside they found a thoroughly waxed
carton that they had to cut open. Everyone
held their breath as their father lifted the top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but a bunch of pictures,&rdquo; said
Martin who was still hoping for pirate treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paintings can be worth a lot of money,&rdquo;
said Dad, &ldquo;thousands or even millions of
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then we&rsquo;re rich!&rdquo; yelled Harley and
Bill together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast,&rdquo; said Dad. &ldquo;First of all, we
don&rsquo;t know if the paintings are really valuable.
Also, it looks like these might be part of
the art treasures that the Nazis stole from the
countries they conquered in World War II.
Maybe someone was trying to get them by
submarine to a neutral country, like Argentina,
just before the end of the war, and the
sub was sunk. If they are real and stolen,
they&rsquo;ll have to go back to their rightful
owners. But cheer up, maybe there&rsquo;s a reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do we collect it?&rdquo; asked Bill. &ldquo;If
the Nazis grabbed them, aren&rsquo;t they real for
sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily,&rdquo; Dad continued. &ldquo;The
Nazis were fooled sometimes by people who
sold them fakes. There was one painting that
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
Hitler&rsquo;s sidekick, G&ouml;ring, bought that was
supposed to be a 17th century painting by
Vermeer, a Dutch painter. Because Vermeer&rsquo;s
work is so valuable, it&rsquo;s usually impossible to
buy one for any amount of money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vermeer is regarded as a national hero
by the Dutch. The matter was investigated
and the painting traced to Han Van
Meegeren, a modern Dutch painter who had
only a fair talent. When Van Meegeren realized
he might be charged with treason by the
Dutch for selling a Vermeer to the Nazis, he
confessed that he had painted it himself. He
also confessed that he had painted other
forgeries that fooled some of the experts and
were sold for a lot of money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many people, however, thought Van
Meegeren was only lying to save himself from
the charge of treason, and the whole thing
had to be decided by a committee of scientific
art experts appointed by a court of law.
Using the methods that were then available,
the experts showed that Van Meegeren had
done a remarkable job of forgery and they
were convinced that he had been telling the
truth about painting those pictures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the time, the important ways the
experts used to examine a painting included
studying the work with X rays, which could
show another painting underneath, analyzing
the pigments (or coloring materials) used in
the paint, and examining the painting for
certain signs of old age.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Van Meegeren was well acquainted with
these methods. He scraped the paint from old
paintings that weren&rsquo;t worth much just to get
the canvas and tried to use pigments that
Vermeer would have used. He knew that old
paint was very, very hard and impossible to
dissolve; so he cleverly mixed a chemical
(phenolformaldehyde) into his paint, and this
hardened into Bakelite when he heated the
finished painting in an oven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For some of the paintings, Van Meegeren
became careless and the experts did find
traces of a modern pigment (cobalt blue) in
the paint. They also found the Bakelite. For
one or more paintings, Van Meegeren did so
well that, in spite of all this evidence, a few
people still weren&rsquo;t convinced that these
paintings were painted by Van Meegeren and
not by Vermeer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill, who by this time was bursting with
questions, interrupted, &ldquo;You mean they still
aren&rsquo;t sure about some of those paintings
after 25 years? Aren&rsquo;t there better ways of
telling whether a painting is genuine or not?
You&rsquo;re a scientist. Can&rsquo;t scientists like you do
something about it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, recently a method was developed to
settle just such a question. It&rsquo;s based on
measurements of natural radioactivity in one
pigment that all artists used hundreds of years
ago. And the method was applied to some of
the Van Meegeren paintings including the best
one of them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it come out?&rdquo; asked Martin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does it work?&rdquo; asked Harley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean paintings are radioactive?&rdquo;
exclaimed Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we do it to the paintings we
found?&rdquo; asked all three together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">How Old Is a Painting?</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;One question at a time. I&rsquo;ll tell you how
the method works and what it does if you&rsquo;re
really interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re interested! We&rsquo;re interested!&rdquo;
chorused the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, this method works
only in certain cases of suspected forgery.
Over the last 50 or 100 years, a number of
paintings have turned up that seemed, even
to the best art experts, to be several hundred
years old. Some of these were genuine, and
some were painted by forgers who could not
resist the high prices paid for works of art. The
National Gallery of Art, in Washington, D. C.,
thinking that there might be a way of
detecting these forgeries, gave its support to a
group of scientists who developed a method
for this purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To understand how the method works,
you need to know a little about how radioactive
atoms disintegrate to form atoms of
other elements. In this case we are interested
in the natural radioactivity that occurs in
certain rocks. As a matter of fact, in almost
all rocks in the earth&rsquo;s crust there is a certain
small quantity of uranium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought uranium was rare,&rdquo; interrupted
Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, but we&rsquo;re talking about such small
quantities that its difficult for scientists using
the most sensitive equipment to detect it. The
uranium in the rock decays to another radioactive
element and that one decays to
another, and another, and another, and so
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
forth, in a series of elements that results in
lead, which is not radioactive. In this series
are two radioactive elements, radium and a
radioactive isotope of lead, that help us to
date paintings. To understand this, we must
first understand how radioactive elements
decay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All radioactive elements have what is
known as a &lsquo;half-life&rsquo;; that is, in a certain
period of time, half of the element disintegrates
to another form. In another equal
period of time, half of what is left
disintegrates, and then half again, and so on.
In the case of the uranium, which starts the
series I am describing, the half-life is over
4,000,000,000 years. Because of its long
half-life there is plenty of uranium around
and will be for a long, long time. On the other
hand, radium, which I mentioned a moment
ago, has a half-life of only 1600 years. In
1600 years, half of it would be gone, and in
another 1600 years half of that would be
gone, and so on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The radioactive lead that we&rsquo;re interested
in has a half-life of only 22 years. This
means that if you start with a small quantity
of this radioactive isotope of lead, which is
called lead-210,<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> then in only a few hundred
years it would have disappeared. However, in
rock, where there is uranium, the uranium
keeps feeding the elements following it in the
series, so that as fast as they decay they are
reproduced by the element before them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand how that
works,&rdquo; said Harley. &ldquo;What do you mean &lsquo;it
keeps feeding it&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, think of a series of lakes connected
by waterfalls. At the top, the highest lake has
an enormous supply of water. Following the
waterfall coming out of the lake you find a
smaller lake and then maybe a medium-sized
lake, and after another waterfall, a smaller
lake, then a tiny lake, and so on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as that big lake on top is full or
nearly full, all the other lakes, whether they
are small or medium-sized, will still be getting
water as fast as it pours out. But if you cut
off the supply of water from the upper lake
to the next lake, then the smaller lakes will in
time run dry. The same thing works with the
radioactivity. In this series headed by uranium,
as long as uranium is present all the
other elements below it are kept supplied so
that they don&rsquo;t run out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand that,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;but how
do we use that to date a painting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the pigments used by artists for
over 2000 years is known as lead white and it
is made from lead metal. The lead metal in
turn is extracted from a rock called lead ore,
in a process called smelting. The radioactive
lead, this lead-210 that I mentioned, behaves
like ordinary lead metal and goes along with
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The radium, which has a fairly long
half-life, doesn&rsquo;t follow the lead metal, but is
removed with other waste products in a
material called slag. Since the longer-lived
ancestor of the lead-210 is removed, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
supply of lead-210 is cut off. (Or we can say
that one of the waterfalls is shut off.) The
lead-210 will then decay with its 22-year
half-life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="587" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The radioactive series that starts with uranium is like a series of lakes
connected by waterfalls. As long as uranium, the big one on top, has
water in it, the others will be full and the falls will keep flowing. But
when the first waterfall is shut off, the small lakes below it will run dry.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I get it,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;That means that
when you take a sample of old lead white
paint, there shouldn&rsquo;t be any radioactive
lead-210 left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. But that would only be true
if you removed all the radium. Actually, in
the smelting process it&rsquo;s more usual to remove
only 90 or 95% of the radium. In that case,
the lead-210 would decay only until the
amount left would be equal to the small
amount of radium that wasn&rsquo;t removed. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
effect, this would be like shutting off only
part of the waterfall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what do you find,&rdquo; asked Harley, &ldquo;if
you measure the radioactivity in a sample of
lead white paint?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We find that if the paint is old, compared
to the 22-year half-life of the lead, let&rsquo;s
say 100 years old or more, then the amount
of radioactivity from the lead-210 in the
sample of paint will be equal to the amount
of radioactivity from the radium in the
sample. But if the paint is modern, let&rsquo;s say
only 20 years old or so, then the amount of
radioactivity from the lead-210 will be greater
than the amount of radioactivity from the
radium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin, who had been quiet through all
this explanation, finally spoke up. &ldquo;Well, was
it finally tried out? How did it work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hundreds of samples were analyzed.
These samples were taken from paintings of
all ages, from some over 300 years old right up
to others only a couple of years old. The old
samples always showed equal amounts of
radioactivity from lead-210 and radium while
the modern ones always showed larger
amounts of radioactivity from lead-210 than
from radium. That meant that scientists had a
way of definitely telling if a lead white paint
was modern or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eventually, the method was tried on a
number of paintings believed to be by Van
Meegeren. Sure enough, every one of them
showed that the paint couldn&rsquo;t possibly have
been more than 30 or 40 years old and that
Van Meegeren probably was telling the truth
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
when he said that he had painted them. The
paintings certainly were not genuine Vermeers
from the 17th century.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, Dad,&rdquo; said Martin, &ldquo;can we use
the method on any of the paintings we
found? Are any of these paintings supposed
to be old enough so that we can use this
test?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast. To find that out we have to
do a lot of checking first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do we go about it?&rdquo; asked Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see now. There are nine paintings
in the box you found. The first thing we
should do is take them down to a museum or
gallery and let the art experts look at them.
Since we have a few weeks of vacation time
left, what do you say we take a trip down to
Washington, D. C., and show them to some
experts at the National Gallery of Art?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks quite a few
things happened to the boys and their paintings.
Three of them were discarded right away
because they were immediately recognized as
being copies of no value. Two were relatively
modern paintings with the signature Alfred
Sisley; if genuine, they were less than 100
years old. The remaining four appeared to be
very old paintings. Two of them seemed to
correspond to paintings that disappeared during
the Second World War. Photographs and X
rays were taken and sent to the museum in
Holland, which had owned the missing pictures,
so that they could make a preliminary
examination.</p>

<p class="pcapc">But when lead-210 decays in the presence
of radium-226, the radioactivity of the lead-210
only decreases until it is equal to the radioactivity
of the radium.</p>
<p>That left two that could have been old
but whose origins were unknown. A series of
simple chemical tests were begun on these and
the boys watched experts take very small
samples of paint for examination under the
microscope. After several months a list of the
pigments present in the paintings was prepared.
All the pigments found were typical of
old paintings and the ordinary examinations
and tests couldn&rsquo;t prove whether the works
were old or not. Finally, it was decided that
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
the only way to tell if these paintings were
truly old was to apply the test that Dad had
described to the boys.</p>
<p>The boys watched a painting restorer
remove samples of nearly white paint right at
the edge of the paintings. He worked carefully,
using a very sharp scalpel and a stereo-binocular
microscope, through which objects
appeared to be sixty times larger than they
really were. The sample of paint weighed
approximately twenty-thousandths of a gram.
The boys and their father took the samples to
a radiochemical laboratory where they
watched a radiochemist do the required analysis
for lead-210 and radium in the samples.</p>
<p>First the chemist dissolved the paint in
acetic acid. This removed the lead white from
the oil and from the small amounts of other
pigments in the paint. The solutions were
then heated and stirred with a silver disc
hanging in the liquid. After several hours the
disc still looked clean, but the chemist said
that a radioactive element, polonium-210, was
now plated onto the silver. Polonium-210 is a
member of the uranium series following the
lead-210, and a measurement of its radioactivity
would be an accurate measurement of
the radioactivity of lead-210.</p>
<p>The silver discs prepared from the two
samples were each placed in an instrument
called an alpha-particle spectrometer. This
instrument is extremely sensitive and can
measure the very small amounts of polonium-210

<p>While the instruments were making the

the chemist turned to the remaining solutions
and began the analyses for radium.</p>

<p>In a series of chemical steps, he purified
the solutions, removing the lead and other
materials so that finally he had a small
amount of solution that contained little else
but the original radium and a very small
amount of barium (an element that he deliberately
added and one which is very similar to
radium in its chemical properties). By adding
dilute sulfuric acid, he prepared an insoluble
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
material, barium sulfate, which was barely
visible suspended in the solution.</p>

<p>By forcing the solution through a special
thin plastic filter having tiny holes, the
particles of barium sulfate together with the
radium that had been in the solution were
caught on the surface of the filter. This was
mounted on a solid disc so that it too could
be placed in the alpha-particle spectrometer
for the measurement of radioactivity from the
radium.</p>
<p>Two weeks later the results were ready.
Dad, the boys, and one of the experts from
the museum met with the chemist to discuss
them. For one of the two paintings, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
polonium-210 radioactivity was about ten
times that of the radium activity. The boys
were disappointed because this meant that
the painting could not have been 300 or 400
years old as it first appeared to be.</p>

<p>But in the second painting the radioactivity
from the polonium-210 and from the
radium-226 were just about equal. That
meant that this painting was at least 100 years
old and, from its appearance, probably more.
The boys were excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a really valuable painting!&rdquo; said
Martin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast, boys,&rdquo; cautioned Dad. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t know who painted it and we don&rsquo;t
know exactly how old it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gallery&rsquo;s expert was happy too. He
believed that the second picture was a genuine
Dutch painting from the 17th century. It was
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
a landscape and the artist might have been
Aelbert Cuyp.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>&ldquo;The Maas at Dordrecht&rdquo;, a genuine painting by Aelbert Cuyp.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo; asked Harley.
&ldquo;How can we prove that the painting was
painted in Holland in the 17th century by
Cuyp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a method now being developed,&rdquo;
said Dad, &ldquo;that could give us that kind
of information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does it work?&rdquo; Martin asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">Who Was the Artist?</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know how criminals are caught
by using fingerprints?&rdquo; asked Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we do,&rdquo; said Martin. &ldquo;Each person
has a set of fingerprints that is different from
anyone else&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley spoke up. &ldquo;Did the artist leave his
fingerprints on the paintings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not,&rdquo; said Dad. &ldquo;Besides, they
would have been wiped off long ago. Also,
who knows what each artist&rsquo;s fingerprints
were like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what do you mean?&rdquo; asked Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I mean is, there is another kind of
&lsquo;fingerprint&rsquo; that scientists are just now learning
to use in all kinds of identification
problems. It&rsquo;s not really a fingerprint, but it&rsquo;s
just as distinctive as a real fingerprint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, in every material, no matter
how pure you try to make it, there are always
other substances contained in it in very, very
small quantities, which are there only by
chance. Usually the person making or using
that material doesn&rsquo;t even know they are
there, and the quantities are so small they
don&rsquo;t do any harm. During the last several
years, scientists have developed extremely
sensitive methods of analysis, which have
been applied to all kinds of problems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One such method is called neutron activation
analysis. In this method these small
amounts of impurities can be detected in tiny
samples of material. This is quite important
because only very small samples can be taken
from a precious painting without damaging it.
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
Normally, a scientist or an art restorer takes
samples that are no bigger than the head of a
pin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you do anything with a sample
that small?&rdquo; asked Bill.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p12.jpg" id="ncfig3" alt="uncaptioned" width="800" height="579" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;With neutron activation analysis you can
do a great deal. To give you an example of
how sensitive this method is, think of a
bathtub containing 500 quarts of milk. Add 1
drop of an acid containing a speck of gold
dissolved in it. After you mix the acid and
milk thoroughly, you won&rsquo;t be able to tell by
looking at it that anything was added. But if
you take a thimble full of liquid out of the
bathtub, you can easily tell with neutron
activation analysis that gold was added to the
milk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scientists call low concentrations of accidental
impurities &lsquo;trace elements&rsquo;, and the
amounts that are present are measured in
parts per million rather than percent. One
part per million is one ten-thousandth of a
percent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill spoke up again. &ldquo;So how does that
make a fingerprint, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;It works this way. Suppose an artist used
lead white in several paintings. Now if the
lead white were absolutely pure it would
contain only lead, carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen.
But the lead white the artist used would
also contain very small quantities of other
elements, these trace elements that I spoke of.
In that particular batch of lead white, certain
trace elements will be present in a certain
quantity. The kind and amount of the trace
elements will be present in that exact pattern
only in that batch of lead white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now suppose you analyze the lead white
from several paintings that you know were
painted by that particular artist, and you find
that there is silver, mercury, antimony, tin,
and barium in every one of the samples. Also,
each of these elements is always present in a
certain concentration. Suppose also, that you
have a painting which looks like it was
painted by that particular artist but you&rsquo;re
not quite sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you take a sample of lead white
from that unknown painting and you find
that the pattern of impurities is the same as in
the paintings you knew were genuine, then
the &lsquo;fingerprints&rsquo; match. The chances of duplicating
impurities of this kind by pure
accident are extremely small, just about as
small as the chances of finding two people
with the same fingerprints. That&rsquo;s why we call
this a &lsquo;fingerprint method&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds like a good idea,&rdquo; said
Harley. &ldquo;Who thought it up?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was thought of many times by many
people. But, it&rsquo;s never been used for identifying
paintings. In 1964 in the Netherlands, two
scientists, named Houtman and Turkstra,
analyzed about 40 different samples of lead
white, 20 of which came from Dutch and
Flemish paintings. The rest were samples of
lead white not taken from paintings but
obtained directly from the manufacturers.
They analyzed these samples for different
elements. These included silver, mercury,
chromium, manganese, tin, antimony, and a
couple of others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They found that the concentrations of
these elements in the lead white from all the
old Dutch and Flemish paintings were very
similar. And the trace element concentrations
were quite different in the modern lead white
samples analyzed in the same way. At the
time, they presumed that it was because the
lead white in the paintings was manufactured
so long ago. They may have been right to a
certain extent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For example, they found that in all the
old paintings there were from 10 to 30 parts
per million of silver in the lead white, while in
the modern samples of this pigment there
were generally less than 10 parts per million
of silver. All of them had been painted before
the 19th century, and all the samples of pure
lead white were manufactured during the
latter part of the 19th century or during the
20th century. They believed that the reason
the silver concentration was lower in the more
modern material was because during the 19th
century, lead refiners were doing a better job
of removing all the valuable silver from lead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>

<p class="pcap"><i>Silver concentrations in lead white. The concentrations generally
decreased after the middle 1800s. Notice also how the concentrations
were very similar for all the older paintings (before 1700) which were
Dutch or Flemish.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;However, in 1967 in Germany, two
men, named Lux and Braunstein, discovered
that in some old paintings produced
in Italy, lead white also contained low quantities
of silver just like modern material. They
believed that the higher concentrations of
silver in lead white were typical of Dutch and
Flemish painters while the lower concentrations
were typical of Italian paintings of
about the same age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole case is still unsettled because
not enough measurements have been made to
show how reliable this method can be. That
is, no one knows if samples of paint from
several paintings by one artist would all have
the same pattern of impurities in the same
pigment. It may be that of the many pigments
present in an artist&rsquo;s paintings only a few will
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
be suitable for use in this &lsquo;fingerprinting&rsquo;
method.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds complicated,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, and it&rsquo;s going to take years of work
before the method is proven, if it is at all. It
may turn out that you can&rsquo;t tell one artist
from another, but only groups of artists like
17th century Dutch painters or 19th century
English painters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us something about neutron activation
analysis,&rdquo; said Martin. &ldquo;How do you
measure such small amounts of impurities?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best way to tell you how this works
is to show you. How would you boys like to
visit a laboratory where neutron activation
analysis is being done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have to ask?&rdquo; said Harley. &ldquo;Of
course we would!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few weeks later it was all arranged. At a
laboratory close by a nuclear reactor, the boys
watched a radiochemist place a few specks of
material inside small quartz tubes that were
then sealed. The tubes were put in an aluminum
can and placed in the nuclear reactor.
The can was fastened on the end of a long
pole that was then submerged in a deep pool
of water. At the bottom of the pool the boys
could see a bright blue glow.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/p15b.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="800" />
<p class="pcap"><i>This type of nuclear reactor
is used for neutron
activation analysis.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what a nuclear reactor looks
like!&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dad. &ldquo;Where you see the blue
glow you can also see rows of fuel elements.
Each one contains slugs of uranium encased in
aluminum. This is one of a number of
different types of reactors. But every nuclear
reactor is arranged so that the uranium atoms
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
divide (or fission) many, many times each
second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When this happens, heat is produced that
is carried away by the water, and also many,
many free neutrons are produced. Those
samples, placed down next to the reactor in
the bottom of the pool are being bombarded
by the neutrons, and some of the elements in
the samples absorb the neutrons and become
radioactive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a while the samples were removed
and carried back to the laboratory in a lead
box. A short while later, the radiochemist
opened the aluminum can, broke open the
quartz capsules, and removed the samples for
analysis. The boys watched the chemist
mount each sample on a card and take it to a
room where there was equipment for measuring
radioactivity.</p>

<p>One by one the samples were placed

boys could see a metal can inside the shield,
which housed a detector (called a lithium-drifted
germanium detector) that measured
the gamma rays emitted by the sample. As

<p>There, on what looked like a small television
screen, flashes of light appeared that
gradually formed a curve with many peaks

columns of numbers.</p>

sample. The typed-out data give us an accurate

energies we know what elements in the
sample were made radioactive. The height of
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
each gamma-ray peak tells us how much of
that element is present in the sample.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That gives us the information we need to
calculate the concentrations of the small
quantities of materials in our samples. We can
do this because at the same time I irradiated a
set of standards. Standards are materials that
are just like the samples except that they
contain known amounts of the impurities I
am trying to measure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the boys were leaving the laboratory,
the chemist apologized for not having enough
time to explain the activation analysis procedure
more thoroughly, but he did give the
boys a list of books to read on the subject of
radioactivity and radioisotopes.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> They

<p>During the ride home, they discussed the

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad that the method of activation
analysis fingerprinting hasn&rsquo;t been fully
developed yet,&rdquo; said Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;Then we could prove
whether or not that last old painting was
really by Aelbert Cuyp as the expert from the
gallery believed. But what about those paintings
that we found in the box that were not
so old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dad, &ldquo;if the activation analysis
method were workable, we might be able
to prove if they were painted by Alfred
Sisley. Meanwhile, until the method is really
developed we don&rsquo;t know if we can do it that
way or not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;So what do we do now?&rdquo; asked Martin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to wait until scientists can
thoroughly investigate this method and
several others that they&rsquo;re working on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other methods!&rdquo; exclaimed Bill. &ldquo;What
other methods?&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">Other New Tools for Art Authentication</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;There are several new tools that scientists
are working on now,&rdquo; said Dad. &ldquo;These
involve methods that have been developed by
scientists for other purposes, but are now
being explored for use in authenticating
works of art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For example, in Los Angeles, the county
museum purchased an instrument known as a
Spark Source Mass Spectrometer. Like activation
analysis, this instrument will also measure
small traces of impurities, but they have
just set that up and it will take them years to
explore the use of it for the type of problem
we have been discussing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;X-ray diffraction is another method that
has been around for quite awhile but hasn&rsquo;t
been used much for art identification until
recently. With X-ray diffraction, samples of
pigments can be identified by the pattern
formed when X rays are bent by passing
through the sample of pigment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Harley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are 3 or 4 different compounds
with about the same chemical composition as
lead white. Chemically, they are almost impossible
to distinguish. But with X-ray diffraction,
a chemist can easily tell them apart. The
hope is that the type of lead white will
indicate how it was manufactured. Until the
middle of the 19th century, lead white was
produced mainly by packing strips of lead in
clay pots with a little vinegar in the bottom.
The clay pots were stacked in a large building
with layers of decaying organic matter on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
floor. The building was sealed for several
weeks during which time the lead corroded in
the fumes and became covered with a white
substance. The white substance, lead white,
was scraped off, ground, and washed to make
the pigment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, in the 19th century, when
people began to learn more about chemistry,
they looked for faster ways of
making lead white and some of these
methods produced a lead white of somewhat
different composition. By using X-ray diffraction,
chemists now hope that they can tell
how the lead white was manufactured. This
may provide another means of dating the lead
white in a painting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any other methods?&rdquo; asked
Harley.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The stack process for making
lead white. Rows of
clay pots containing lead
and vinegar are packed to
the ceiling of the building,
and fermenting tanbark on
the floor produces carbon
dioxide and heat. The
fumes of vinegar and the
carbon dioxide corrode
the lead in 2 to 4 months,
and the corrosion is lead
white.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, isotope mass spectrometry is one.
All lead consists of 4 different isotopes or
atoms of different weights. Three of these 4
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
are the end products of a radioactive decay
chain. Depending upon the history of the
rock formation in which the lead ore occurred,
the relative amounts of the lead
isotopes vary in a special way. In other words,
if we know the different amounts of lead
isotopes in the world&rsquo;s lead ore deposits, and
we have a sample of lead white from a
painting, we can tell from which deposit the
lead, which formed the lead white, came. If,
for example, we find that the isotope pattern
in a sample from a painting is the same as in
lead ore from Australia, then the painting
can&rsquo;t be very old because lead white wasn&rsquo;t
produced from lead mined in Australia until
about 100 years ago.&rdquo;</p>

20th-century invention.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you measure lead isotopes?&rdquo;
asked Harley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With an instrument called a mass spectrometer.
This instrument is capable of
separating the lead isotopes. First, the atoms
of lead in the sample are electrically charged
and &lsquo;fired&rsquo; in a beam down the length of a
tube between the poles of a strong magnet.
There, the charged atoms (or ions) in the
beam are deflected by different amounts
according to how heavy they are. Thus the
different isotopes are separated. This method
is also still being studied and, although it
shows great promise, it will be some time
before it can solve problems of art identification.
Also the study of the natural variation in
isotopes of other elements, such as sulfur,
is useful for identification of other pigments
as well.</p>

travel in a beam at the same speed. The heavier atoms bend less than
the lighter ones when the beam passes the magnet. Thus two beams

will be four beams.</i></p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;Another new method that shows great
promise has been developed, but this one is
not applicable to the paintings that you boys
found in the box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the Second World War, the art
forgery business has been growing rapidly.
For example, it has been said that of the 2000
pictures that Corot, a 19th century Frenchman,
is known to have painted, more than
5000 of them are in the United States. This
may be only a humorous exaggeration, but a
large number of forgeries have been produced
in the last several years. These are usually
supposed to be paintings that are less than
100 years old. Present-day forgers like to
forge paintings that aren&rsquo;t very old because
it&rsquo;s easier to get away with. Now this new
method, which will detect such recent forgeries,
is based upon the presence of carbon-14, a
radioactive isotope of carbon, in our atmosphere
and in all things that grow on our
planet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ordinarily, carbon-14 is produced only
by cosmic rays, and its concentrations in the
atmosphere and in growing things would
remain at a constant level. But since the
middle of the 1950s the testing of nuclear
weapons has increased the amount of radioactive
carbon in our atmosphere by quite a
bit. Many artist&rsquo;s materials, such as linseed oil,
canvas, paper, and so on, come from plants or
animals, and so will contain the same concentrations
of carbon-14 as the atmosphere
up to the time that the plant or animal dies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore, linseed oil (from the flax
plant), for example, produced during the last
few years will have a much greater concentration
of carbon-14 in it than linseed oil
produced more than 20 years ago. Scientists
at Carnegie-Mellon University have shown
that this method will work. It is only a matter
of making the measurements on the small
samples available from presumably valuable
paintings.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig28">

<p class="pcap"><i>The changing concentrations of carbon-14 in our atmosphere. High
levels of carbon-14 in linseed oil and other painting materials will
indicate that a work of art is only a few years old.</i></p>
</div>
<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>Carbon-14 radioactivity</dt>
<dd>Older materials contain less as the carbon-14 decays away.</dd>
<dd>In this period, decrease is due to the burning of large quantities of coal and oil as industry grew. This diluted the newly formed carbon-14.</dd>
<dd>Increases due to testing of atomic weapons in the atmosphere.</dd>
<dt>Carbon-14 produced by cosmic rays only</dt>
<dd>Neutron &rarr; Nitrogen &rarr; Carbon-14 + proton</dd>
<dd>Carried down by rain in carbon dioxide</dd></dl>
<p>&ldquo;There are also a number of other
methods being studied including the use of
Messbauer Effect Spectroscopy to study pigments
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
that contain iron, thermoluminescent
dating of pottery and terra-cotta statuary,
X-ray fluorescence analysis as a general tool,
and neutron autoradiography as a means of
studying the technique of artists. You can
read all about them if you wish.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like forgers are going to have a
tough time in the future,&rdquo; said Harley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. It may even turn out that
producing forgeries to pass all these new tests
will be so difficult and expensive that forgers
will stop trying.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">One Mystery Solved</span></h2>
<p>A year later an important letter arrived at
the boys&rsquo; house. Dad opened it, read it
quickly, and said, &ldquo;Good news, boys! This
letter is from the Dutch government. Remember
those two paintings that we thought
might have been stolen from a Dutch
museum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it seems that after a year of
studying them, the Dutch have decided that
they really are the paintings that were
stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is good news,&rdquo; said Harley. &ldquo;At
least we know that two of the paintings we
found are genuine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they going to do with them?&rdquo;
asked Martin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, they have to go back to their
original owners. But this letter says that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
Dutch government wants us to come to
Holland as their guests as a reward for finding
those paintings.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig29">
<img src="images/p21.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="452" />
<p class="pcap"><i>These two paintings &ldquo;The Lacemaker&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Smiling Girl&rdquo; were
thought to have been by Vermeer. A series of tests, including some of
those described in this booklet, showed that the paintings are fairly old.
However, some of the materials used are not typical of Vermeer, and the
pictures are now thought to have been painted by a follower of the artist.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;Looks like
we&rsquo;re getting something out of finding that
box after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dad. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t forget the
other unidentified paintings may also be
genuine. We&rsquo;ve proved that one is a fake, the
experts believe that three of the others are
copies, and then there are the two that might
be Sisleys and are only waiting for a method
to prove it. And we have one more that
science managed to prove was really old. I&rsquo;m
sure that in a few years methods will be
developed to tell us exactly who painted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now let&rsquo;s make arrangements for
our trip to Holland.&rdquo;</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
